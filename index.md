**When:** Friday, April 28th, 2023 @ 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM

**Presentation: The Ever-Unachievable Practical Security** 
<blockquote> 
In this talk, I will walk through an analysis of general risks and threats to businesses, some of the current issues folks find implementing security programs, and then walk through a more practical, sustainable, and more implementable version of the process. I’m drawing on the many failures I’ve seen over the years and pointing out the simple reasons for why they didn’t work.
